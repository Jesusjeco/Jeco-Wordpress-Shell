	<h1>Jeco Wordpress Shell</h1>
	<p>Developer oriented Wordpress starter theme.</p>
	<p>It offers you a folder structure, already connected with Gulp as a task manager and a basic file structure to jump
		directly into coding and adding the blocks required for any project.</p>
	<p>It has a basic hello-world already added to be used as a starting point. It also includes a list of my suggested
		plugins.</p>

	<h2>Notes</h2>
	<p>The files used are NOT an obligation. As a developer feel free to destroy/adjust all you need. The purpose of this
		theme is NOT to force a UX/UI but to offer an initial structure to save time.</p>
	<p>I am adding some default styles but those are mostly to give you a starting point. Every single style file that you
		should need, is located in the <code>src/</code> folder. All the names are pretty self-explanatory.</p>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Once you cloned the repo, activate the plugins. It is recommended to activate one by one so you can apply the
			configuration individually and according to your taste.</li>
		<li>Activate the theme <strong>Jeco-Wordpress-Shell</strong></li>
		<li>In your code editor, go to the themes folder and then to the <strong>Jeco-Wordpress-Shell</strong> folder.</li>
		<li>Now that you have activated the theme, let's go with the environment.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Environment</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Open the terminal in the theme's folder to run the commands coming up.</li>
		<li>Make sure you are using the right Node version. You can take a look at the <code>.nvmrc</code> file and install
			the corresponding Node version, but I suggest you use NVM and run the command:
			<pre><code>nvm use</code></pre>
		</li>
		<li>Let's run <code>npm i</code> to set up all the dependencies.
			<pre><code>npm i</code></pre>
		</li>
		<li>PROBABLY you do not have Gulp installed globally. So let's be sure you do. If you want to follow the
			instructions from the main site, here it is <a href="https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start"
				target="_blank">text</a>
			<pre><code>npm install --global gulp-cli</code></pre>
			and then
			<pre><code>npm install --save-dev gulp</code></pre>
		</li>
		<li>With gulp installed locally and globally, run once the command <code>gulp</code> to be sure that it compiles all
			the files.
			<pre><code>gulp</code></pre>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>At this point the theme files are compiled and ready to be used. You are now set up to use WordPress with a default
		configuration. However, as a developer, you will be looking to create your own blocks.</p>

	<h2>Adding Blocks</h2>
	<p>We all have our ways.</p>
	<p>For this theme I am letting a copy of a block registration in the theme
		folder/includes/blocks-setup/register-blocks.php.</p>
	<p>Right there you will see the code to register the hello-world I have as a default. You can copy and use it for your
		own blocks.</p>

	<p>Also, there is the register-styles.php. You can use it for the regsitration of the styles. Using that strucutre,
		the style files are going to be print in the head, instead of the footer and only if the current view is using the
		specific block you are setting up.</p>

	<h2>Notes</h2>
	<p>As developers, you will not want to run the <code>gulp</code> command every time. For that you can use the watcher
		functionality and it will re-compile your changes while you are working.
	<pre><code>gulp watcher</code></pre>
	</p>

	<h2>Next Steps for the Future</h2>
	<p>My plan is to optimize this theme structure and make it WooCommerce available, to also have basic blocks that use
		the WooCommerce API in order to let all the tools available for developers to only work in the HTML and CSS of the
		WooCommerce pages, and let all the other functionalities ready to go, such as Purchase Cart and Payment
		integrations.</p>
